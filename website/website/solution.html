            <p>
                People with amnesia often struggle to recognize familiar faces, which can lead to difficulties in identifying friends,
                family, or regular visitors at their home. This inability can severely disrupt their social interactions and compromise their safety.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Testable Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                Users who experience amnesia who use our facial recognition door camera experience a higher level of confidence when 
                answering the door as opposed to without one.
            </p>

            <h3>Measurement:</h3>
            <p>
                Noting the ability of our algorithm in combination with the camera module to recognize and classify people.
