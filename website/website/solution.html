            <p>
                People with amnesia often struggle to recognize familiar faces, which can lead to difficulties in identifying friends,
                family, or regular visitors at their home. This inability can severely disrupt their social interactions and compromise their safety.
            </p>

            <h2>Testable Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                Users who experience amnesia who use our facial recognition door camera experience a higher level of confidence when 
                answering the door as opposed to without one.
            </p>

            <h3>Measurement:</h3>
            <p>
                Noting the ability of our algorithm in combination with the camera module to recognize and classify people.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p> We want to integrate a face recognition component to a ring doorbell which will help people with amnesia identify their visitors.</p>
            <p>This is how our facial-recognition doorcamera will work:</p>
   
            <ul><ul>
                <li>First we take a short 4-5 second video of the subject's face and send it to our telegram bot</li>      
                <li>User is asked to name the person in the video to train the neural network</li>
                <li>When the camera of the doorbell is turned on it checks if the subject is close enough</li>
                <li>If the subject is close enough and is recognised, it sends a message on telegram.</li>
            </ul></ul>
